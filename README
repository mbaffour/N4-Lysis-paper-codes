N4-Lysis-paper-codes

This repository contains code accompanying the manuscript on N4 lysis.  
It includes scripts for data formatting and visualization used in the analysis and figure preparation for the paper.

Overview
The repository is organized into subfolders, each containing a dedicated README file:

FASTA Formatting Scripts – utilities for reformatting FASTA files.  
Growth Curve Plotting Scripts – tools for plotting changes in optical density (OD) over time to visualize bacterial lysis dynamics.

Each subdirectory includes usage instructions and example input/output files.

Purpose
These scripts were developed to support reproducible analysis of experimental data and figure generation for publication.
